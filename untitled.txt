Notes for finance algorithm:

* gathered regression data

    * % Change vs.
        * Float Shares --> x <= 163017544
        * Market Cap --> x <= 22276022969
        * Shares Outstanding --> x <= 203205294
        * Lastly, and most complicated, will be the actual text
     
    
* actual live testing

    * check above conditions

    * EMA?
    **** volume AND price increase, volume and price higher than 5 minutes ago
    * equals a certain percent of 5 minute voulume
